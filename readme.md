## hori-hori

A personal dotfiles templating and management framework written in a hundred lines of bash.

- Toml-inspired configuration language
- Logicless recursive templating
- Package-like management

See [hori-hori](https://github.com/tsbohc/hori-hori) for more info.

## addendum
- I'm not a programmer by trade, but I like writing code. As such, it is very [opinionated](https://i.redd.it/se5rfanqhqx11.jpg).
- Feel free to look around, fork, and praise or yell at me in an issue!
- Giving credit is appreciated.

Thanks!
