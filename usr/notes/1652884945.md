string parameter substitution

```
a='hello:world:of:tomorrow'

${a%:*}  => hello:world:of
${a%%:*} => hello
${a#*:}  => world:of:tomorrow
${a##*:} => tomorrow
```

or string manipulation in bash, remove substring before character, etc

## removing leading zeros

the following would remove all the leading 0s from the string:

$ string="000123456000"
$ echo "${string#"${string%%[!0]*}"}"
123456000
saying "${string%%[!0]*}" would return the match after deleting the longest trailing portion of the string that satisifies [!0]* -- essentially returning the zeros at the beginning.

"${string#"${string%%[!0]*}"}" would remove the part returned by the above from the beginning of the string.
