fzf -> custom commands

and on pressing : with a file or multiple selected i get to a prompt with

| <selection>

(the bar being the cursor) so typing "cd<enter>" would take me to the directory, rmdir would call that respectively, etc

could also add custom keybindings for quick actions (like r for rename)
and contextual ones (enter on a directory cds in there, enter on a text file opens it in editor)

i wonder if its possible to preload a terminal and just hide it until a key combo is pressed, that way it'll be pretty much instant
