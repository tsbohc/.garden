- a power menu (with mouse clicks) that launches with a click on polybar

bash

- new script command with header and chmod +x

rofi

+ autolaunch startx on tty1 *finally*
- keybind browser for hlwm that executes the keybinding on select
- man page browser that opens vim with :Man $1 | only

hlwm

- make hlwm ask before killing a terminal with a running process (e.g nvim)

no, it wouldn't be better to go with fennel for hlwm autostart

no, it wouldn't... i'd still have to write my own brace expansion and get yelled at for using braces where i'm not supposed to

also it's not portable
